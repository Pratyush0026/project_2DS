#Student Attitude and Behavior Analysis
#Introduction
The "Student Attitude and Behavior Analysis" project delves into understanding the factors influencing student performance and behavior in academic settings. By examining various aspects such as demographics, academic performance, study habits, and social behavior, this analysis aims to uncover insights into students' attitudes and behaviors towards education.

#Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

#Loading the Data: This section focuses on loading the dataset and performing initial data exploration.

#Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, one-hot encoding categorical variables, label encoding, and scaling numerical features.

#Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

#Training The ML Models: Various machine learning models are trained on the data to predict the target variable, which is the salary expectation. The models include Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Machine (SVR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

#Hyperparameter Optimization: Hyperparameters of some models are optimized using techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to improve model performance.
